- simple ipc handler
- fast, multi-client
- as simple as possible, but not simpler
  - very stable to work as intended from first try,
    but minimal on supported functionality and checks
  - extra features to be added as needed
- fail fast
- relies on asserts() even for runtime checks
  - goal
    - keep implementation simple
    - crash program to get attention
    - highligh exact failure place for a fix
  - if forced by future use cases - will consider standard error handling
- platforms: mac, linux
- small set of classes
  - Socket
    - owns file descriptor and socket path
    - handles socket init/close logic
    - provides primitive send/receive commands
  - Server
    - registers ipc interface
    - runs listener in a background thread
    - if new message
      - reads it
      - optionally spawns a new thread (configurable)
      - triggers registered callback
      - passes whatever was read to it
      - writes back response from the callback
    - supports stop() to unblock accept and shut down cleanly
  - Client
    - provides call() for one-shot request/response
  - message len controlled by integer header, no other overhead
- uses unix sockets
- in the future can be extended to use other ipc mechanism if needed
  (e.g. win support, net sockets)
